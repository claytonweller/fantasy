# Fantasy Guild Fantasy League

It’s a fantasy sports league but in a fantasy setting. 

We’re in a standard fantasy world which has monsters, adventurers, magic, and all the usual trappings. Adventurers accept quests from the Adventurers guild, and then get rewards based upon the difficulty upon completion. To complete more difficult quests adventurers have to specialize and team up into parties, and eventually join/create larger more permanent organizations called Clans. In this world these adventurers’ exploits are public record through the guild, and as such they are analogous to professional athletes in our world. Clans are like sports franchises/teams. 

Instead of playing as an adventurer you play as a townsperson, who is following the “season” at the guild and is creating a fantasy “Clan.” Every week you pick adventurers, then depending upon what they do, you get points. You play in a league against other villagers, at the end of the season the person with the most cumulative points wins!


## Status
Currently I'm just noodling around. This is a completely frontend react websited. There's no API or DB anything everything is just dummy data. My plan is to playtest using spreadsheets, the output the values from there into a CSV, then parse that into hosted data on update. Is this a long term solution? No absolutely not. Is it lightweight and easy to change? Yes. That's what I need right now. Prototype baybeee!
